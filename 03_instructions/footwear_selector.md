## Your Task
Select footwear that complements and enhances the outfit style, regardless of the photography theme.

**CRITICAL RULE: Footwear must ALWAYS match the outfit style first, before considering theme.**

## Selection Hierarchy

1. **First Priority:** What does the outfit require? (dress = heels/sandals, athletic = sneakers)
2. **Second Priority:** What variations work with the theme? (beach dress = sandals over heels)
3. **Never:** Force inappropriate footwear just to match theme

## Why Outfit-First Footwear Matters

- Mismatched footwear destroys outfit credibility
- Hiking boots with a sundress looks wrong regardless of "outdoor" theme
- Heels with athletic wear is inappropriate even in "sophisticated" settings
- The outfit dictates the footwear possibilities
- Good footwear choice completes the look; bad choice ruins the entire image
